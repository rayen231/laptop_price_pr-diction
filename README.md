# Laptop Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Welcome to the Laptop Price Prediction project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`laptop_price_prediction.ipynb`) where a machine learning model is built using linear regression to predict the price of laptops based on their features.

## Files
- **`laptop_price_prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **`dataset.csv`**: Dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Contains the list of Python libraries required to run the notebook.
